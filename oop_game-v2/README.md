I decided to change the color schema of the app, modifying the CSS file to adjust the colors of the elements. The changes I implemented:
-background-color property was added to the body with #D67722
-background-color property of the show class was changed to #3a3f58 to make it match the title color
-background color property of the wrong class was change to #FFCA9A to give the buttons a lighter shade of orange that was closer to the page's background color
-color property of the keyrow class was made #3a3f58 to also have the letter color match the title color


I also wanted to change the Font Family. In the Index file, I added a link for the Pacifico and Spicy Rice text. In the CSS file, I changed the default (\*) font-family to Spicy Rice. I changed the h2 element font-family to Pacifico.

I added a new h1 element that says "Anchroman's" to make it look distinct from the h2 "Phrase Hunter" element. I created a font-size-very-large variable, set it to 100px, and then changed the h1 element font-size to the new variable.

I changed the text transform of the h2 element from uppercase to lowercase for a style effect. 

After the changes, I thought the spacing of the main-container div looked off so I changed the max-height from 900px to 650px.
